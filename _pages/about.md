Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

The IUT Vision-Language Reading Group aims to provide a collaborative platform for discussing research ideas, academic papers, and emerging directions within the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. Our goal is to foster intellectual growth through weekly paper reading sessions focused on CV and NLP, idea sharing, and exploration of new research directions. We strive to create an inclusive and supportive environment where researchers, students, and enthusiasts from all backgrounds are welcome to engage, learn, and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in these interdisciplinary fields.

By encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration and the exchange of diverse perspectives, VLRG seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications in computer vision and natural language processing. We actively support the development of innovative solutions that address real-world challenges, while also nurturing the academic growth of our members. Whether you are a seasoned researcher or just starting your journey in these fields, VLRG provides a dynamic space for learning, networking, and pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in AI and machine learning.
